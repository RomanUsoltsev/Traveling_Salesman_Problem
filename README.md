# Traveling_Salesman_Problem
Solving the traveling salesman problem using the genetic algorithm method using the python language.

Formulation of the problem. This laboratory work is devoted to the consideration of the solution of the 
geometric traveling salesman problem based on the genetic algorithm. The input to this algorithm is a 
certain number of cities and their X, Y coordinates on the plane. The algorithm must build the shortest 
route through all cities and return to the starting point.
